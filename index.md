## Exploring SAT and ACT State Averages ([Repo](https://github.com/JamesDargan/ACT-SAT))

I measure the impact of student self-selection into participation on college prep exams and explore the resulting bias introduced to state rankings based on state average scores using data scraped from various digest tables published by the NCES for the classes of 2017 and 2018. By incorporating case studies and analyzing changes between years, I demonstrate a causal connection between participation rates and state averages on the ACT and SAT. I produce a MLR with an adjusted R2 of 0.805 and mean absolute error of 0.68 points when explaining 2017 ACT scores, which predicts 2018 scores with a mean absolute error of 0.75 points.

Utilized Python and Plotly to collect data from online sources and create interactive U.S. Maps to compare state averages and participation rates on the SAT and ACT exams.

[Predicting State Averages](pages/ACT-SAT/02_participation.md)<br>
Utilized Python and Stats Models to quantify the relationship between test participation rates and states averages, I demonstrate state rankings from these assessments misrepresent the relative quality of state education systems through the bias of student self-selection.

[Modeling Impact of State Education System Features](pages/ACT-SAT/03_state_char) <br>
Incorporating state level spending per student, average class size, and average teacher salary as a proxy for teacher quality, I model how these affect state performance on college admissions tests after controlling for participation. I show failing to account for the selection bias produces drastically biased coefficients and lower explanatory power.

## AMES Housing Regression ([Repo](https://github.com/JamesDargan/AMES))

Provided with a variation of the classic AMES real estate dataset for a private Kaggle competition, I perform extensive EDA, impute missing values across 10 features including a regression imputation model, and engineer new features. I build an OLS on a selected subset of provided and engineered features which reaches an R2 score of 0.97. I demonstrate my OLS model outperforms L1 and L2 regularized models as well as principal components regression. I then buid a voting classifier based on OLS, Random Forest, and XGBoost models which improves test peformance by 10% as measured by root mean squared error.

[Validation and Missing Imputation](pages/AMES/01_cleaning.md) <br>
I use pandas and missingno packages to identify missing values and inconsistent variable totals. I proceed to  impute values for 30 observations across 10 features based on class probability estimation. I create a linear regression imputation model for lot frontage with an average margin of error of about 10%.



[Regularization and PCA](pages/AMES/03_linear_models.md) <br>
I build an OLS model on selected and engineered features which delivers an R2 score of 0.967, a root mean squared error of 20,128, and mean absolute error of 9,777, which outperforms simple base models by 58% or more. I explore incorporating regularization and principal components into my linear model.
