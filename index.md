## Exploring SAT and ACT State Averages ([Repo](https://github.com/JamesDargan/ACT-SAT))

I measure the impact of student self-selection into participation on college prep exams and explore the resulting bias introduced to state rankings based on state average scores using data scraped from various digest tables published by the NCES for the classes of 2017 and 2018. By incorporating case studies and analyzing changes between years, I demonstrate a causal connection between participation rates and state averages on the ACT and SAT. I produce a MLR with an adjusted R2 of 0.805 and mean absolute error of 0.68 when explaining 2017 ACT scores, which predicts 2018 scores with a mean absolute error of 0.75.

[Visualizing State Differences ](pages/ACT-SAT/01_visualization.md) <br>
Utilized Python and Plotly to collect data from online sources and create interactive U.S. Maps to compare state averages and participation rates on the SAT and ACT exams.

[Predicting State Averages](pages/ACT-SAT/02_participation.md)<br>
Utilized Python and Stats Models to quantify the relationship between test participation rates and states averages, I demonstrate state rankings from these assessments misrepresent the relative quality of state education systems through the bias of student self-selection.

[Modeling Impact of State Education System Features](/sample_page) <br>
Incorporating state level spending per student, average class size, and average teacher salary as a proxy for teacher quality, I model how these affect state performance on college admissions tests after controlling for participation. I show failing to account for the selection bias produces drastically biased coefficients and lower explanatory power.
