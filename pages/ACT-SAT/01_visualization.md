## Interactive Visualizations with Plotly ([Repo](https://github.com/JamesDargan/ACT-SAT))

**Project Component:** After collecting data on state averages on the SAT and ACT exams for the graduating classes of 2017 and 2018, I utilized Plotly to generate informative maps comparing these states.

**Primary Takeaway:** States with policies or cultures which favor near or universal participation on the ACT and minimal participation on the SAT tend to rank at the very top for SAT average and very low on ACT average. A similar pattern holds in the opposite scenario.
