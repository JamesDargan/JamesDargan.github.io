## Robust SLR Evidence

**Project Description:** I utilized Python and stats models to create detailed summaries of simple linear regressions bteween state average scores and participation rates. I find robust evidence of high correlation between these variables, finding participation significant at the 99% confidence level and an R2 over 0.70. Over 70 percent of state to state variation across exams can be explained by differences in the proportion of graduating students completing a college admissions exam.

**Insight 1: SAT and ACT state averages negatively correlate**<br>

**Insight 2: SAT and ACT trend negatively with increased participation**<br>

**Insight 3: Participation explains most variance in state averages**<br>



**Primary Takeaway:** When reporting relative rankings of states on the SAT or ACT as measured by average student exam score, blogs and news sites fail to recognize these ratings derive primarily from differences in participation rates rather than any underlying features of states' education system or quality of students. States with extremely high or low averages should not be praised or criticized without additional evidence given how biased these rankings are.
