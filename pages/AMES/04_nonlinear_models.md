## AMES Housing Regression ([Repo](https://github.com/JamesDargan/AMES))

**Project Component:**
Building on my high-performing OLS model of housing prices, I explore non-linear models which more flexibly capture the relationships between by many categorical features and sale price. I build a equal-weighted voting classifier of OLS, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to reduce my training error by 34%.
