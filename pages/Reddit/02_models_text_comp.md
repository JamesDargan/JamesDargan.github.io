## Subreddit Classification ([Repo](https://github.com/JamesDargan/Reddit_Classification))

**Project Description:**
Utilizing Reddit's Pushshift API, I scrape reddit posts and comments from two similar subreddits, /r/pcgaming and /r/boardgames, with the goal of utilizing NLP techniques to classify posts into the correct subreddit. I take a bag-of-words approach using both CountVectorizer and TFIDF techniques. I then train three foundational classification models: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive-Bayes, and Linear Support Vector Classification.
